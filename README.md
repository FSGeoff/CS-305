## Benefits of secure coding

- __Protecting sensitive information__: Secure coding practices help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data such as customer information, financial records, and intellectual property.
- __Preventing financial losses__: Software security vulnerabilities can lead to financial losses for companies. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to carry out attacks such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, or identity theft, resulting in financial damages, legal consequences, and reputational harm.
- __Maintaining customer trust__: Customers expect the companies they interact with to protect their personal information and maintain their privacy.
- __Meeting regulatory compliance__: Many industries have specific regulatory requirements regarding data protection and security. By implementing secure coding practices, companies can ensure compliance with relevant regulations and avoid penalties or legal issues.

## Value that software security adds to a company’s overall wellbeing

- __Reputation and brand protection__: A company's reputation is crucial for success. A security breach or vulnerability can lead to negative publicity, damage to the brand's image, and loss of customer trust. Investing in software security helps protect the company's reputation and brand value.
- __Business continuity__: Security incidents can disrupt business operations, leading to downtime, loss of productivity, and financial losses. By implementing robust security measures, companies can minimize the risk of such disruptions and ensure business continuity.
- __Cost savings__: While investing in software security may require upfront resources, it can save a company from significant financial losses in the long run.
